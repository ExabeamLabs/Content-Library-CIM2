Crash dumps are created whenever the system experiences a crash, and contain a dump of the its memory. Attackers can disable crash dumps through the 'CrashDumpEnabled' registry value, thus making sure no traces are left when or if a crash will occurs.                         | 2023-07-31T14:30:00.000+00:00 |     registry-create      |
