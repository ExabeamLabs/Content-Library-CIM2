# Exabeam Content Library
Based on the Common Information Model 2.0

Welcome to the Exabeam Content Library.

The Content Library is an online repository of knowledge and content that organizations can use to learn about available log source integrations and security use cases.

This library reflects the hierarchical framework of the Exabeam Common Information Model. The library is programmaticly generated  from the Exabeam content repository. As changes are made to the information model, or new content is addedto the content repository, the Content Library is automatically updated to provide fast and easy access.

## How do I use it? 

The Content Library contains information about parsers, events, models, and rules. It shows what content is available and how the content elements map to one and other. To use the library, find your version of Advanced Analytics and drill into the information in one of the following ways: 

- <b>Data Sources</b> – Click Data Sources and select a vendor and a product that are the source of specific data. View the activity types, the parsers, and the number of rules and models Exabeam employs to cover this data source. Drill down further to view the parser syntax or the names of the rules and models. 

- <b>Use Cases</b> – Click Use Cases and select a specific use case. Exabeam supports use cases in the following categories: compromised insiders, malicious insiders, and external threats. View tables for each vendor and product that the use case supports. Each table shows the relevant activity types, parsers, and the number of supported rules and models. Drill down further to view the names of the rules and models. 

- <b>Product Categories</b> – Click Product Categories to view a list of products arranged by categories. Select a product to view the activity types, parsers, and the number of rules and models Exabeam employs to cover this data source. Drill down further to view the parser syntax or the names of the rules and models. 

The Content Library also includes a list of prebuilt correlation rules. In addition, you can browse other resources to understand how the library is based on the Common Information Model 2.0, including a list of platforms and landscapes and a list of field descriptions.
